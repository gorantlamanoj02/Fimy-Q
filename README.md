# Fimy-Q
This is a Quiz App which I developed largely using Javascript and Html, Css technolgies for a presentable interface.

To Run this,

1. Download the zip file and extract them out of the folder.
2. Open the folder through VScode.
3. Use the live server extension and run through it.

The opening interface of the Quiz App actually looks like this -

End of quiz looks like this -

This app currently is static i.e., it uses static questions and answers which are given under the javascript quizdata but it can be further improved and be made as dynamic i.e., providing dynamic data and shuffling of quiz options everytime the page is refreshed.
